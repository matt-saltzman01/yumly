# Chefly

Group project for UI and Mobile Apps at JHU.
The directory should be titled Chefly, not yumly.
An APK from 5/13/2017 is located in the root directory with the name "chefly.apk".
Chefly allows you to search for recipes based on what you have in your fridge, and save the ones that you like.
